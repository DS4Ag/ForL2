Week 10 Lab
Spatial Analysis of Forest Inventory Data

Objective
This lab focuses on spatial analysis of forest inventory data using a Digital Terrain Model (DEM). You will extract slope and aspect from the DEM, visualize spatial patterns, and analyze the distribution of forest attributes (e.g., basal area, biomass) across the study area.

Materials Needed
1.	Ground Digital Terrain Model (DEM) of study unit 2 (`unit2.img`).
2.	Summary table from Week 9 Lab (`sum_u2.csv`).
3.	Shapefile of sample plot locations (`HEE_Overstory_Survey_Points_2017 - Copy `; ensure all 7 related files are saved in one folder).
4.	You may need to install and load ‘terra’, ‘tmap’, and ‘sf’ packages.
